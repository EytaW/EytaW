# Introduction
👋 Hi, I’m @EytaW. Fun fact, Eyta is what my mom likes to call me. It really warms my heart whenever I got called as Eyta. You may call me by my first name or Eyta if you'd like to :)

👀 I’m interested in getting a formal education in Computer Science. My initial background was Chemical Engineering working in renewables sector. I created A LOT of block flow diagrams, Signal Sensors and feedback loops. I'd be happy to help your project if you are dealing process control that requires some programming skills.

🌱 I’m currently learning C++ through several course and some teaching opportunities. I'm also learning JAVA and PYTHON via project based approach instead of the traditional course.
