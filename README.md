# Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EytaW. Fun fact, Eyta is what my mom likes to call me. You may call me by my first name or Eyta if you'd like to :)

Iâ€™m interested in getting a formal education in Computer Science. Getting education in computer science is truly a previllege that I wished to have the opportunity to pursue. The competition is intense for admission for universities and employers often raised their eyebrows when you did not come from a traditional background. I hope that this repositories gives you confident that I can and will excel in any endeavor I choose to pursue in the field of computer science. It is an honor to have you read this page!



ðŸ‘€My initial background was Chemical Engineering working in renewables sector. I created A LOT of block flow diagrams, Signal Sensors and feedback loops. I'd be happy to help your project if you are dealing process control that requires some programming skills.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ through several course and some teaching opportunities. I'm also learning JAVA and PYTHON via project based approach instead of the traditional course.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please send me email!
